H﻿i,

I﻿ am Kaiyi Jiang, a PhD student in Biological Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) advised by Jonathan Gootenberg and Omar Abudayyeh. I obtained my B.S. (Summa Cum Laude) in Biologicial Engineering from Rice University in 2021.

At Rice, I was fortunate to have worked with Prof. Caleb Bashor on post-translational synthetic circuit for mammalian cell reprogramming. 

I am broadly interested in all reprogrammable systems for genome engineering, synthetic biology, and gene and cell therapy
