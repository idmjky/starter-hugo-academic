H﻿i, 

I﻿ am Kaiyi Jiang, a PhD student in Biological Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) advised by Jonathan Gootenberg and Omar Abudayyeh. I obtained my B.S. (Summa Cum Laude) in Biologicial Engineering from Rice University in 2021.

At Rice, I was fortunate to have worked with Prof. Caleb Bashor on post-translational synthetic  circuit. I am broadly interested in genome engineering, synthetic biology, and gene and cell therapy. [ Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) on using data structure techniques to accelerate large-scale distributed neural network training and DNA sequence query. I am broadly interested in buidling systems for deep learning workloads.
