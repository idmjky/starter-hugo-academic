abstract: Programmable approaches to sense and respond to the presence of
  specific RNAs in biological systems have broad applications in research,
  diagnostics, and therapeutics. Here we engineer a programmable RNA-sensing
  technology, reprogrammable ADAR sensors (RADARS), which harnesses RNA editing
  by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) to gate translation of a cargo
  protein by the presence of endogenous RNA transcripts. Introduction of a stop
  codon in a guide upstream of the cargo makes translation contingent on binding
  of an endogenous transcript to the guide, leading to ADAR editing of the stop
  codon and allowing translational readthrough. Through systematic sensor
  engineering, we achieve 277 fold improvement in sensor activation and engineer
  RADARS with diverse cargo proteins, including luciferases, fluorescent
  proteins, recombinases, and caspases, enabling detection sensitivity on
  endogenous transcripts expressed at levels as low as 13 transcripts per
  million. We show that RADARS are functional as either expressed DNA or
  synthetic mRNA and with either exogenous or endogenous ADAR. We apply RADARS
  in multiple contexts, including tracking transcriptional states,
  RNA-sensing-induced cell death, cell-type identification, and control of
  synthetic mRNA translation.
